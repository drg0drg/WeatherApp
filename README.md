# Weather App
    

## Description 
    
The Weather App uses OpenWeather API and allows you to quickly check the weather forecast for every city world wide.

Written in JS ES5, the app dynamically generates info at each city search and uses local storage to provide a list of previous searches, for convenience and ease of use.

The two sections of the app are:

- Main tab shows information for today:
    - City
    - Date
    - Icon depicting the weather type
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Wind speed
    - UV factor index with color scheme to protect your skin and eyes

- Forecast for five days:
    - Date
    - Icon depicting the weather type
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
